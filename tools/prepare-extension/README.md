# prepare-extension
Prepares the extension for distribution by setting the staff/student configuration. That's literally the only thing it does.

## Usage
The prepared files will be placed in `src.prepared`.

To set the configuration as `student`:
```bash
node prepare-extension.js student
```

To set the configuration as `staff`:
```bash
node prepare-extension.js staff
```
