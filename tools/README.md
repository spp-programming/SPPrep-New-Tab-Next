# Tools
These tools exist to aid in some repetitive tasks.

## make-zip
Creates a zip file locally that can be uploaded directly to the Chrome Web Store. It ensures that only the prepared source files are included at the root of the archive. You need to run `prepare-extension` first to set the configuration as either staff or student.

## prepare-extension
Prepares the extension for distribution by setting the staff/student configuration. That's literally the only thing it does.
